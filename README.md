# Deep Learning Workshop

This project, developed by Rom Granot, Sharon Saban, and Michael Best, explores the iconic TV show "Seinfeld" through the lens of deep learning. Our goal is to analyze dialogue and episode structure to uncover patterns, sentiment, and character interactions within the series. This README provides an overview of our methodology, datasets, and key findings, inviting collaboration and further exploration in the fascinating intersection of television and artificial intelligence.
