Guess what? I just started my own business. I'm a bookie!

KRAMER
[quickly] Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.

PEGGY
Oh, it was no problem.
ELAINE
[leaving with the drawings] Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
PEGGY
[focusing on her work] Thanks, Susie.

JERRY
What for?
KRAMER
Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one.
Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
JERRY
But I don't want any "sweet action."
KRAMER
Well, I couldn't do it: I got a gamblin' problem.

Yeah. See that--
PEGGY
[preoccupied] You know, it's amazing Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.
She practically ran the company into the gro-ound.
ELAINE
Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..

Hero (Believe it or not)," written by Mike Post and Stephen Geyer).]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up
the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]
(JERRY's on the other end, a little bored. But GEORGE likes the song, bobbed his head with it.)
JERRY
George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
GEORGE
[answers phone, good mood] Hey.
JERRY
So, coffee shop?
GEORGE
No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. [the call waiting beeps]
Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. [hangs up]
GEORGE
[on tape, singing] "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up
the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." [beep]
(GEORGE was grooving to it, pantomime-shrugging during it, and remoting to another station.)
ALLISON
[on phone machine, peeved] George? Are you there?
[muttering] I hate that stupid message.
[terse] I know you're avoiding me, I'm at the office, please call me, I've gotta talk to you. [hangs up]
[GEORGE dials a number.]

Can you believe this woman?
JERRY
[ironic outrage] The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
ELAINE
No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
JERRY
No. No Suze.

Hey, I thought you went to the game.

Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
KRAMER
[stops] W--Reggie Miller.
ELAINE
Cheryl Miller's brother?
KRAMER
Yeah. [leaving]
JERRY
Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!
KRAMER
[stops again] Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an'
he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. [leaving]
ELAINE
[same time as JERRY] --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--
JERRY
Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!
KRAMER
[stops again] Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved."
An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
ELAINE
So that's it?
KRAMER
Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. [leaves]
JERRY
Can you believe that?
ELAINE
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
KRAMER
[suddenly comes back, excited] The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
JERRY
What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
KRAMER
No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it
riiiide!
JERRY
On what?!
KRAMER
[real addict] Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on
the ponies. [getting out pocket-watch]

ELAINE
Su-sie?
PETERMAN
Yes. Between you, me and the lamppost. And the desk.
Peggy says this "Suze" isn't much of a Worker.
ELAINE

the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.

MIKE
[comes up] Hey. Jerry.
JERRY
Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
MIKE
[a little anxious] Yeah! How 'bout 'em? Ha ha. Look, Jerry. I can't pay you.
JERRY
Why not?
MIKE
'Cause I don't have the money..
JERRY
Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
MIKE
Just give me 'til Friday. Please. Please!
JERRY
You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
MIKE
I'm sorry. Uh--oh here--let me give you a hand with that.
[MIKE gets some groceries out.]
JERRY
[trying to shut the trunk hood] Something wrong with this trunk.

GEORGE
So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner?
[amused] An' why Pomodoro?
[Just now, at one table in the background, a WOMAN is sad and dismayed, says, "How could you say that to me?" She
cries..]
KRAMER
[quiet, delicately] Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
GEORGE
[quiet] Uh-oh.
KRAMER
We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
GEORGE
Can't we discuss this?
KRAMER
[reasoning] We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
GEORGE
[dismayed] I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
KRAMER
[dismayed] So what am I in this for?
You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. [is tearing up]
GEORGE
[pause] Are you?
KRAMER
Wha--me? No! No. But she is.
GEORGE
I, I can't believe this is happening!

Just Hold On a minute. Still One Short.
ELAINE
Oh.
No, we're not--
PEGGY
Susie has been very rude to me.
PETERMAN
Well, Elaine, has nothing but Good things to say about Susie.
ELAINE
Look.
[engaging smile] We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or..
[breathes in] name names!
[indicating empty chair] Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
PETERMAN
Don't you drag me into this! This is between you and her, and her. [indicating empty chair]
ELAINE
Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
PETERMAN
Who.
ELAINE
[uh-oh] Her?
PETERMAN
Where is she?!
ELAINE
Ah--this is part of the problem!
PEGGY
Iiii thought I was, part of this problem.
ELAINE
[smiling, convincing] You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that
requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
PETERMAN
Well, now that we have that cleared up.. why don't the three of us have lunch.

KRAMER
Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
JERRY
Well why doesn't he just come in?
KRAMER
Because he's scared, Jerry.
JERRY
Why is he scared.
KRAMER
[sighs, opens door] Come on in.
Did you do this? [MIKE has two hand casts on]
JERRY
Yeah, but--
KRAMER
Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.
JERRY
It was an accident.
KRAMER
Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
MIKE
[desperate] I'll get you the money, Jerry. I got a hundred dollars in my front pocket if you want to, reach in an' take it!
JERRY
[hands up] I don't want it that way.
KRAMER
Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
JERRY
[whatever] Fine..
MIKE
Oh--uh--thank you, Jerry, thank you! I won't forget this, I'm gonna fix your trunk good--real good!
[MIKE's very grateful, and leaves with a two thumbs-up gesture. But he also can't help giving a thumbs-up--that's the position the casts hold his thumbs in. It's odd!]
KRAMER
See that was nice, Jerry. [under breath] Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
JERRY
Ah, it's just a car.
[GEORGE comes up (the door's still open) and when he and KRAMER see each other, there's an awkward, long pause. During the following, JERRY sits at the table silently watching, intrigued.]
GEORGE
Hi.
KRAMER
[looking down, nodding] Hi.
[Another pause. It's like they broke up--well they did, but they didn't.]
GEORGE
It's, funny runnin' into you here.
KRAMER
Yeah, yeah..
It's funny.
You look good..
GEORGE
[embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut] Do I? Thanks.. You too..
KRAMER
Ooo, yeah.. [indicating his face, embarrassed] {Heh, right.}
You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
GEORGE
[sad] Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
KRAMER
George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. [leaves]

[Outside it's raining. MIKE is working on Jerry's trunk, trying to get at the locking mechanism but it's hard with those casts on.]
MIKE
Thumbs!
[He gets into the trunk for better access. But it turns out KRAMER is getting into his car, parked just ahead of Jerry's, and he bumps Jerry's car while backing up and the trunk slams shut. It locked this time!]
MIKE
[from inside the trunk] Oh!
Help!
Somebody, help! Help!

JERRY
So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
ELAINE
Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
JERRY
Yeah, I know how you feel.
(Meanwhile, MIKE's yelping and banging in the trunk!)
ELAINE
Do you hear something?
JERRY
What?
(Meanwhile, MIKE, in a now-hoarse voice is shouting, "Jerry?! Jerry?!")
JERRY
Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
ELAINE
Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
JERRY
Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
ELAINE
What?
JERRY
[firmly matter-of-fact] Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
ELAINE
I kinda like her.
JERRY
She's Gooone.
ELAINE
Jerry--
JERRY
[impatient] Gone! [starts maniacally laughing]
[briefly stops to point and explain] That bumper sticker.

[The next day, ELAINE's passing by the door of PETERMAN's office.]
PETERMAN
Elaine! Where's Susie? I want her to head up our new Fingerless Glove Division.
ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
PETERMAN
Mmmmm--nah.
ELAINE
All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie..
[difficult subject, quiet] she took her own Life..

ELAINE
[quiet] Look at this turnout.
JERRY
[quiet] Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
ELAINE
[irritated] Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
[They've found seats together in the row in front of PEGGY, who looks like she's seeing a ghost!]
PEGGY
[to herself] Oh my god!
[quiet] Susie?
ELAINE
[quiet] Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.
PEGGY
But I've been calling you Susie.
ELAINE
Oh! Hadn't noticed!
Excuse me. [she's going to the podium]
PEGGY
I guess I never met Susie.
JERRY
[privately amused] Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while.
[indicating ELAINE] Her too.
[ELAINE's now at the podium.]
ELAINE

[Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, PETERMAN arrives in his little red convertible (top down), distracted with
disappointment/sadness. He parks behind Jerry's car and bumps it. Jerry's trunk has unlatched but not popped open big.
PETERMAN doesn't notice anything and goes in. Shortly after he passes, MIKE comes out of the trunk, squinting in the
daylight, his body is sore, he shuts the trunk.
Nearby, there's a small announcement sign (with stick-in white letters):
TODAY'S
SCHEDULE
LIEBERMAN BARMITZVAH
<--
SUSIE'S MEMORIAL
-->
(approximation)
MIKE sees it and is alarmed! He's still disoriented but hobbles away with determination!]

[Tavern on the Green, at dusk. The Pinstripe Ball is starting. The walls there are mahogany, and there are short, decorative
columns with flowers on top of them. Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns, and the music is mellow and quiet. GEORGE is
waiting in a tux for Allison, but KRAMER arrives in his rather tight tux. They talk quietly.]
KRAMER
Hey.
GEORGE
Where's uh, where's Allison..
KRAMER
Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.
GEORGE
But you took me back.
KRAMER
Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut.
How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years.
All right, eh. [heading in]
GEORGE
Where are you goin'..
KRAMER
The Ball, silly.
GEORGE
[afraid not] No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
KRAMER
George. I thought you were gonna Change.
GEORGE
[impatient] For her. Not for you.
KRAMER
[light admonishing, under breath] Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
[They start struggling quietly, KRAMER's trying to just walk by, and GEORGE is trying to restrain him without attracting too
much attention.]
GEORGE
All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
[GEORGE had KRAMER in a slightly spinning hold--by holding the back of KRAMER's tux--but the material tore away, and
this sent KRAMER spinning into the room with the back torn off his tux! Strangely, this is well-received by WILHELM!]
WILHELM
Wow! What an, Entrance!
[friendly, to GEORGE] And eh, who might this be?
KRAMER
Oh, I'm with him.
WILHELM
Oh. Ah-ha..

[Meanwhile at the Memorial, ELAINE is still at the podium. She has her chin in her hand while talking, weary of making up
things and of acting mournful.]
ELAINE
And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
PETERMAN
Elaine! May I say a few words.
ELAINE
Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. [steps down]
PETERMAN
[steps up to the podium, refreshed] Ahhh.
I don't think I'll ever be able to forget Susie--ahhh. And most of all, I will never, forget that one night. Working late on the
catalogue. Juuust the two of us. And we surrendered to temptation.
And it was Pretty Good.
JERRY
[proud to PEGGY, under his breath] Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. [winks]
[ELAINE (who has returned to her seat) catches JERRY's eye. Though we don't see her face, his drops and he sobers it up.]
PETERMAN
But Iiii never heard her Cries for Help. [sighs]
An' nowww.. Susie is gone.
MIKE
[running in, still hoarse, desperate!] Hold on! Hol--on!
Susie didn't commit suicide!
[rushes up to podium!] She was Murdered, by Jerry, Sein-feld!
[While MIKE's pointing at JERRY and everyone's looking, JERRY looks back at PEGGY again.]
JERRY
[smugly, under-his-breath] Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
[PEGGY and ELAINE look at him strangely as he grins during such an inappropriate moment.]

PETERMAN
Elaine? Guess what. I've decided to Form a Charitable Foundation, in Susie's honor. And as Susie's best friend, I want you to
be involved.
ELAINE
Mr. Peterman..
[leaning forward, whispering] I'm Susie.. She's me..
PETERMAN
[leans forward, whispers carefully] I feel the same way.
[announcing] And that's why this foundation will meet around Your Schedule. Nights! Weekends! Every, Free Moment you
have. [leaving, pats her shoulders confidently]
ELAINE
[looks up, screaming in frustration!] Suuuuuuuuuuze!
[(During her screaming up to the air, the camera was over her, looking down, and turning around and around, just like it had
when GEORGE found out that he was going to be running a foundation in honor of Susan!)]
